Lesson 1 A                           private                              conversation Last                    week I went to the                   theatre. I had a                     very good seat?                      The play was very                    interesting. I did                    not enjoy it? A                     young manand a young                  woman were sitting                  behind me. They                      were talking                         loudly. I got very                    angry. I could                      not hear the                         actors. Iturned                      round. I looked at                    the man and the                     woman angrily.                       They did not pay                     any attention. In                    the end, I could                     not bear it.                         Iturned round                        again. 'I can't                      hear a word!' I                      said angrily?                        ¡®It¡¯ s none of                     your business,' the                   young man said                      rudely. 'This is                     aprivate                             conversation!'.
